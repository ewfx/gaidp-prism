* **Invalid Characters in ObligorName:** Review the ObligorName field and remove any special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*(), etc.) or formatting that isn't alphanumeric or standard punctuation. Ensure the name matches official records.  Compliance step: Refer to the institution's naming convention policy.

* **Invalid TIN (Taxpayer Identification Number):** Verify the TIN against official sources (e.g., IRS database for US entities). If incorrect, obtain the correct TIN from the obligor. If the entity is foreign, ensure the appropriate foreign tax identifier is used. Compliance step: Document the TIN verification process.

* **Invalid Ticker:** Confirm the ticker symbol with a reliable financial data source (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters). If incorrect, research the correct ticker or determine if one exists.  If no valid ticker exists, this field should be left blank. Compliance step:  Refer to the institution's security master file policy.

* **Invalid CUSIP:** Verify the CUSIP with a CUSIP service provider or a reliable financial data source.  Correct the CUSIP if incorrect. If the security doesn't have a CUSIP, explore alternative identifiers (e.g., ISIN).  Compliance step: Document the CUSIP verification process.

* **Unnecessary Purpose Description:** Similar to the facility description, if the purpose duplicates information or is irrelevant, remove it. Maintain clear and concise purpose descriptions. Compliance step: Refer to the institution's data entry standards for loan purposes.

* **Unapproved Line of Business:** This indicates the transaction falls outside the institution's authorized activities.  This requires escalation to a senior manager or compliance officer for review and approval. The transaction may need to be rejected if it cannot be justified. Compliance step: Refer to the institution's approved lines of business policy.

* **Invalid Reserve Amount:**  Review the calculation of the reserve amount. Ensure it aligns with the institution's reserve policy and regulatory requirements. Correct any calculation errors. Compliance step: Document the reserve calculation methodology and rationale.

* **Audit Trail:** Ensure a clear audit trail exists for all changes made to the transaction record.
* **Training:** If errors appear systemic (e.g., repeated date format issues), consider refresher training for staff.
* **Root Cause Analysis:** For recurring issues, perform a root cause analysis to identify underlying process or system deficiencies and implement corrective actions.
* **Policy Review:** Regularly review and update policies and procedures related to data quality and compliance to prevent future errors.
