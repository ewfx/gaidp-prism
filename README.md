## 🎯 Introduction
We have developed an **intelligent Data Profiling Agent** that automates **data validation** in the banking sector, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards set by organizations like the **Federal Reserve**. Our solution efficiently processes large datasets, identifying regulatory violations, assessing **risk scores**, detecting **anomalies**, and providing **record-specific remediation actions**. This streamlines compliance, enhances data integrity, and mitigates financial risks for banks.

## 💡 Inspiration
Traditional data validation is a manual, time-consuming process requiring expert knowledge. Investigating validation failures is equally challenging. Given **Generative AI’s** capabilities in handling complex tasks, we leveraged **GenAI** to automate and streamline the validation process, significantly reducing effort and enhancing accuracy.

## 📊 Architecture Diagram
![Alttext](https://github.com/ewfx/gaidp-prism/blob/bff5485db47e924069edad82116825feed1d2ffb/architecturediagram.png)<br>
--This project uses the rules extracted from Corporate Loan Regulation section of Federal Reserve document, interprets them and automatically genrates a validation script for validation of users data.<br>
--The user can provide their own data and has an option to either run the existing rules on the data or he/she can refine or add custom rules. <br>
--Validation results are generated by giving the context of the modified/added rules (if modification is made) to the LLM model (gemini-1.5-pro) which will generate a validation script specific to the users case. It also gives a risk score for each recoed.<br>
--Anomaly Detection is performed to flag anomalous transaction using Isolation Forest approach.<br>
--After Validation is complete the user can choose to filter by customer ID and download specific remediation report or get a remediation report for all records.<br>
--The Remediation report has details such as riskscore, flagged features which have violated rules, Anomalous or Safe flag and remediation advice generated by <br>

## ⚙️ What It Does
Our application offers the following functionalities:

✅ **Interprets** data validation rules from **Federal Reserve documents** and auto-generates validation scripts.  
✅ **Allows customization** of rules via an **interactive chat interface**.  
✅ **Acts as a Subject Matter Expert (SME)** in **banking regulations**, particularly **Corporate Loan Regulations**, assisting users in clarifying doubts.  
✅ **Performs risk scoring** and **anomaly detection** for deeper insights into customer patterns.  
✅ **Generates detailed reports** on findings and **suggests remediation actions**.  
✅ **Supports PDF report generation** for single records or complete datasets.  
✅ **Ensures responsible AI use** by preventing misuse of GenAI capabilities.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
Our application integrates the following technologies:

🔹 **PDF Processing**: `pdfplumber`, `tabula`, `reportlab` for **data extraction & conversion**.  
🔹 **Data Processing**: `pandas`, `numpy` for **efficient dataframe operations**.  
🔹 **LLM Model**: `Gemini 1.5 Pro` for **content & script generation**.  
🔹 **Prompt Engineering**: Optimized LLM prompts for **accurate script generation & remediation suggestions**.  
🔹 **Anomaly Detection**: `Isolation Forest` for **pattern & anomaly detection**.  
🔹 **UI Framework**: `Streamlit` for **a seamless user experience**.

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
🔹 **Extracting accurate validation rules** from **bulky Federal Reserve documents** was complex.  
🔹 **Testing limitations** due to API **rate limits & usage constraints** made recursive testing challenging.
